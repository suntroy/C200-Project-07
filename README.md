# Project Name
This is my final project for MSCH-C220 in Fall 2025!

## Theme
When I heard "one button," my mind immediately went to clicker games. I used what I remembered from when I last played Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and Stimulation Clicker (https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/) as inspiration. 

## Game Play
Keep clicking, and experience the whole game to its completion!

## What did you struggle with (or what surprised you?)
Since the original repository was set up in 3D, it did take me a moment at the beginning of the project's development to figure out how to switch it back. After watching some previous videos and reading on Unity's website, I was able to figure it out. 

## Implementation COMPLETE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

## Special Focus COMPLETE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)
